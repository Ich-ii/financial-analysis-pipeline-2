      "The entity exhibits weakened short-term liquidity and elevated leverage relative to conservative benchmarks. Current Ratio is 0.9 and declining, indicating available current assets may be insufficient to cover current liabilities on a conservative basis. Debt to Equity is 2.1 and slightly increasing, reflecting materially higher reliance on debt financing. Interest Coverage is 2.8 and stable, which is close to but below commonly used conservative comfort levels. Liquidity Risk Score is 0.78 and Solvency Risk Score is 0.82, both indicating heightened risk under conservative assessment.\n",

      "- Current Ratio (0.9): Exceeds conservative risk threshold. A Current Ratio below 1.0 typically signals inadequate short-term liquidity to meet obligations as they come due.\n",
      "- Debt to Equity (2.1): Exceeds conservative risk threshold. A Debt to Equity above 2.0 indicates higher-than-conservative leverage, increasing solvency risk and sensitivity to interest rate or cash-flow shocks.\n",
      "- Interest Coverage (2.8): Approaches/exceeds conservative concern threshold. An Interest Coverage below ~3.0 is commonly considered low by conservative standards and reduces the margin to service debt from operating earnings.\n",

      "recommendations:\n",
      "- Strengthen short-term liquidity: prioritize actions to raise the Current Ratio to at least 1.0, preferably higher, through working capital improvements (accelerate receivables, manage inventory, defer non-essential payables) or secured short-term financing.\n",
      "- Reduce leverage or improve equity base: consider deleveraging strategies (targeted debt repayment using non-core asset disposal or operating cash flow) or capital measures to lower Debt to Equity toward or below conservative benchmark levels.\n",
      "- Protect interest-servicing capacity: maintain or improve operating earnings and assess hedging or refinancing opportunities to reduce interest expense and increase Interest Coverage above conservative thresholds.\n",
      "- Contingency planning: establish or confirm committed liquidity lines and stress-test cash flows under conservative downside scenarios to ensure the entity can meet obligations if conditions deteriorate.\n",
